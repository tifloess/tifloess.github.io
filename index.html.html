  <h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>My name is Tabitha Floess...</h2>
<p>... and I am currently a student at Wake Technical Community College, pursuing dual degrees in Computer Programming and Engineering. I have a professional background in graphic and 3D design and am passionate about leveraging AI to improve user experiences and solve real-world challenges. As a Point Scholar and Raj Mehta Endowment recipient, I actively engage in programs like NASAâ€™s L'SPACE and the Society of Women Engineers to advocate for diversity and inclusion in STEM. As a Flyin Ryan Adventure Grant recipient I also advocate for personal health and living in the moment.</p>
